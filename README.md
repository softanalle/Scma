Spectro Cutometer Application for Android

Although this application is available under open source license, it should be noticed, that it requires special hardware available from http://www.delektre.fi/ .

The application might not follow the published "Best Practices" of Android or IOIO resource usage. So, if you use ideas or portions from the code in real life applications, use enough time to test your application. What works for us, might not work for you. And of course, it might be that we have negletted some testing. So in clear text: "we take no liabilities if you destroy your hardware or cause any other damages, when using our code in it".
